Notes :

* Status :
    * Completed : Already implemented algorithm and have animation
    * Not completed : Have algorithm space but not implemented algorithm and not have animation
    * Not implemented : Not have any algorithm space or header
    * Algorithm Only : Already implemented algorithm but not have animation
    * On Working : Already handled and in progress
